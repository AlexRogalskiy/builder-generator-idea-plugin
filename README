Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that adds ability to generate builder for a class and switch between them.
Switching to builder (and back) is similar to 'Go To Test' action.
Requires gradle and IntelliJ IDEA for building.
Build instructions:
- edit build.gradle and change values of 'ideaInstallationPath' and 'ideaJdk' to be in sync with your environment
- invoke 'gradle build' from command line to build
- invoke 'gradle idea' from command line to generate IDEA specific files - provides possibility to be opened as IDEA project.
